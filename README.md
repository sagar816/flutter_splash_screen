# flutter_splash_screen

Splash screen uses: 
1) To show logo
2) To make api data fetch and load and instead of showing loading we can show splash screen

Need to pop out in navigation stack, should not go back on splash screen
Like after login, you should not mae user to come back to login screen. This UX is bad

Use push replacment - we are entering stack and replacing the earlier stack layer. So the splash screen in the stack will be replaced by our new dashboard screen. So in backpress it works properly.

In flutter - we have timer class

After some said duration, the navigator code will start executing.
So search starting point and so we need to manage state - init state
When first time when page is built - first function that will be called is initstate function
In this function write timer and navigation code.

Init state fun is found in statefull widget only

For api - On state Loaded Use
